# password.py

password.py is a Python project designed to help users generate secure passwords and provide assistance with common computer operations.

## Features

- **Password Generator:** Easily create strong, random passwords for your accounts.
- **Computer Assistance:** Offers guidance and helpful functions for operating your computer.

## Installation

You will need Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher recommended).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-web186/password.py.git
cd password.py
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

It’s good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

If your project has a `requirements.txt` file, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there’s no requirements file, you can usually run the script directly.

## Usage

You can run the main script to generate a password or access computer assistance features:

```bash
